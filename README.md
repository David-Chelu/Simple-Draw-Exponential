# Simple-Draw-Exponential
A simple drawing of an exponential function's area on the whole window, using TGL.

In namespace Exponent is the variable exponent, which by default is set to 2. This value can be modified, but the factor must be tweaked as well.
Inside main are 4 values worth mentioning: color (defined through RGB or TGL::Pixel()), factor (squishes the graph so it's visible on screen), width and height (size of the window and image).
